FLAW 1: A04:2021 – Insecure Design

https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/accounts/views.py#L68

https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/accounts/templates/recover.html

Description: 
	Account recovery is way too easy if the username is known and they are visible if the account has an active listing. During registeration a security question (only one) is selected and an answer is provided. If the answer is correct, a form for changing the password is given to the user. According to OWASP Top 10 and other credible sources, questions and answers are not a secure enough authentication method because more than one person can know the answers. Another issue is that weak passwords are allowed, the only requirement is that it is at least 4 characters in length.
	
Fix:
	The most obvious way to fix this would be to:
		1. Verify the email during registration.
		2. Get rid of the security questions and answers
		3. Instead of asking for a username for the forgotten password form, an email address would be required.
		4. Access to the change password form would be provided in the email.
		5. Verify that passwords are strong enough by making sure that it it at least a certain length, and contains letters and numbers. 
		
		Note: For privacy reasons the email regsitration and verification is not provided in the code.

FLAW 2: A03:2021 – Injection (Cross-site Scripting)

https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/flaws/2.%20Injection/csrf.html 
https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/market/views.py#L31

Description: 
	Shortly put, a scammer can make the user buy a product if the user accesses the site containing "csrf.html". It is possible because of the lack of a csrf_token to verify that the request came from the same website. To replicate the issue, the tester must:
		1. Create at least two accounts. One who will be "scammed" and another that owns the listings. 
		2. Add an ad that will be sold by the scammer
		3. From the "/listads" page you have to view the source (on chrome ctrl u) and grab the value of ad_id
		4. Log in as the account about to be scammed.
		5. Edit the csrf.html file so that the src in the img tag has the correct value for ad_id
		6. In the file containing csrf.html run "python3 -m http.server 9000"
		7. In a browser open up "http://localhost:9000/csrf.html"
		8. You can check the scammed accounts bought items (browse your listings on -link on the front page) if the item in question is one of them.
		
	
Fix:
	Pretty simple fix, just remove the csrf_exempt tag from the function and add {{ csrf_token }} into the buy form in the listads.html file. I also changed the request method from GET to POST, so that a simple link embeded into an image is not enough to make any changes to the code.

FLAW 3: A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Description:
	There are basically no logging features implemented into the project. which could be used to detect for example:
		1. Scammers selling items for extortionate prices
		2. Spam creating listings which would affect the visibility of legitimate listings
		3. Suspicious logins or login attempts from unfamiliar ip addresses
		4. New listing should go through a filter to ensure that no illegal or unwanted items are up for sale
		
Fix:
	I'm not going to go into too much detail but adding a log model that contains the user logging in, time of said user logging in, and the location (ip address) where the user has logged in from. Another fix is going through a list (not provided in the code) to ensure that the item for sale is safe.

FLAW 4: A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/market/views.py#L52
https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/market/templates/listpersonal.html#L13

Description:
	Users can access the personal webpage of other users, where they can view the items up for sale, which is intended, and also delete these listings, which is not intended. Another thing that only the owner of the page should be able to view, which is the bought items, is in plain sight of all users accessing the page.

Fix:
	1. Hide the delete button unless the user viewing the page is the owner of the page.
	2. Hide the bought items from users who are not the owner.
	3. Verify in the function, that the person logged in deleting the ad ,is also the owner of the ad.

FLAW 5: A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

https://github.com/JerryTammi/CyberSecurityBaseProject/blob/main/cybersecproj/accounts/fixtures/fixtures.json#L38

Description:
	Inside the fixtures.json file the questions are fine but the default users with weak passwords, no email accounts, and no security questions or answers. This includes the admin account that has superuser privileges which could make major changes to the app through the admin menu.
	
Fix:
	Just delete the default users from fixtures.json file. Normal users can be created in the app itself, with no required fields missing, and the admin account can be created manually with the "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" command.
	
Note: Not sure why the textfield for submitting the report contains -200 words compared to the .txt file I wrote the report with.
