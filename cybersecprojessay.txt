Description: 
	Account recovery is way too easy if the username is known and they are visible if the account has an active listing. During registeration a security question (only one) is selected and an answer is provided. If the answer is correct, a form for changing the password is given to the user. According to OWASP Top 10 and other credible sources, questions and answers are not a secure enough authentication method because more than one person can know the answers.
	
Fix:
	The most obvious way to fix this would be to:
		1. Verify the email during registration.
		2. Get rid of the security questions and answers
		3. Instead of asking for a username for the forgotten password form, an email address would be required.
		4. Access to the change password form would be provided in the email.
